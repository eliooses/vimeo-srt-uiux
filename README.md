Vimeo SRT plugin - UI / UX

Resources for this issue: [https://github.com/Yomguithereal/vimeo-srt/issues/3](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/vimeo-srt/issues/3)

==============

Here is a #Screenr #update of the mockup integration working: [http://www.screenr.com/wLAH](http://www.screenr.com/wLAH)

Now yes have some something of .js (here i put all the necesary files): [https://github.com/eliooses/vimeo-srt-uiux](https://github.com/eliooses/vimeo-srt-uiux)

In this coming days i will work on display appropriately the subs and optimize the UI/UX integration.

I remind what this is just a demo for now. I have to work hard on several things such as:

* Listen the Froogaloop events like pause and play.
* Integration with @Yomguithereal plugin.
* Give to the final user a simple way to embed this like (and everything renderized):

        <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/71278954?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ff005a" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
        <script src="http://example.com/vimeo-srt.min.js"></script>
* etc.

Again, best regards. : )
